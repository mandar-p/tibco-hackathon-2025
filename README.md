## ‚ö° Quick Start

### 1. **Setup Configuration**

```bash
# Copy configuration template
cp config/config.json.template config/config.json

# Edit with your credentials and paths
nano config/config.json
```

**Required Configuration:**
```json
{
  "anthropic": {
    "api_key": "your-claude-api-key",
    "file_id": "your-tibco-documentation-file-id"
  },
  "bwdesign": {
    "executable_path": "/path/to/bwdesign",
    "workspace_path": "/path/to/workspace",
    "project_output_path": "/path/to/output"
  },
  "git": {
    "url": "https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo.git",
    "token": "your-git-token"
  }
}
```

### 2. **Build & Launch**

```bash
# Install dependencies and build
make deps && make build

# Start the AI Command Generator (Terminal 1)
./bin/api-server

# Start the Project Builder (Terminal 2)
./bin/executor
```

### 3. **Generate Your First Project**

```bash
# Send natural language prompt to AI
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/generate-commands \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "user_prompt": "Create a REST API that receives customer data, validates it, transforms it to XML, and sends it to a legacy system via FTP",
       "api_url": "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages",
       "api_key": "your-api-key",
       "model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
     }'
```

### 4. **Deploy to Repository**

```bash
# Upload generated project to Git
./bin/git-uploader
```

Your BWCE project will be automatically created in the `BWProject/` directory and pushed to your repository!
